# SVG Barcode Generator

Simple one-dimensional [barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode) generator focused on scalability and
themability.\
Created to be easy to use, lightweight, and compatible with [Tailwind CSS](Tailwind).

## Supported code formats

- [upc_a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code)
- [ean_13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number)
- [ean_8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number)
- [code_128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128)
- [code_93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_93)
- [code_39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39)
- [codabar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codabar)
- [itf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved_2_of_5)

## Why to use this library

- Creates responsive [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) graphics that adapt to parent container sizes.
- Is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) friendly (you can easily apply foreground and background colors).
- Can be used in the browser ([ES2017](https://caniuse.com/?search=es2017)) and in runtimes such as
  [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
- Can be used in frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/),
  etc.
- Can be used in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). Should be compatible with
  [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) and [Unistyles](https://www.unistyl.es/).
- Names of formats are compatible with
  [Barcode Detection API formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API#supported_barcode_formats).
- Is dependency-free.
- Is easy to use.

## Why you shouldn't use this library

- It has not been battle-tested yet. Might have bugs.
- Whether the project will be developed further depends on my willingness to work.

## Idea

Among the libraries available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), none met my needs. Some lacked
[tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking), others required complex configurations
just to generate decent looking SVG, and some applied colors that couldnâ€™t be easily overridden with Tailwind. So, I
decided to create my own library.

## Usage

#### Common

```ts
import TsBarcodeGenerator from "simple-barcode-generator";

const barcode = TsBarcodeGenerator.generate("7423522549551", "ean_13");

console.log(barcode);
```

#### React + TailwindCSS

```ts
import TsBarcodeGenerator from "simple-barcode-generator";

export const YourComponent = () => {
  const barcode = TsBarcodeGenerator.generate("7423522549551", "ean_13");
  return (
    <div className="p-6 bg-white fill-current text-black">
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: barcode }} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- [Wikipedia.org/Barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode)

## TODO

- [ ] Check ean_13 (seems to be broken)
- [ ] Add support for upc_e (the last one of planned 1D formats)
- [ ] Add automatic testing
